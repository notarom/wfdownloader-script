/*
THIS IS A COMMENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS CODE DOES, IT CAN BE REMOVED.
The code below (from line 13) will extract links from any scrollable
page when given the css selector for the element type and the attribute
to serve as the link. Here, only the extra options are explained.
1. 'minNumOfScrolls' = '15' means that the page should be scrolled at least 15 times
2. 'maxNumOfScrolls' = '100' means that the page should be scrolled at most 100 times
3. 'maxNumOfConsecutiveSameResults' = '5' means if the software scrolls and there isn't
any link, it shouldn't stop scrolling until it has scrolled 5 consecutive times without
any new link.
4. For info on searchMode, cssSelector, selectorAttribute, see previous example.
