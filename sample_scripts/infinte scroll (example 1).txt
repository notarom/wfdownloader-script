THIS IS A COMMENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS CODE DOES, IT CAN BE REMOVED.
The code below (from line 13) will extract links from any scrollable
page when given the css selector for the element type and the attribute
to serve as the link.
1. The searchMode was set to element here. Other possible values are link, regex.
2. css selector here is 'a[role]' and link attribute 'href'. Other sample
css-selector/attribute pair and what they do are:
a. To get all images - 'cssSelector' = 'img', 'selectorAttribute' = 'src',
b. To get all clickable links - 'cssSelector' = 'a', 'selectorAttribute' = 'href',
All acceptable values are: normal, extensive, extreme.
