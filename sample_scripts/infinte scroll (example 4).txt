/*
THIS IS A COMMENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS CODE DOES, IT CAN BE REMOVED.
The code below (from line 13) will extract the links to the screenshots
on the scrollable steam community page https://steamcommunity.com/id/Draegonn/screenshots/
1. '/ugc/' was used as the filter pattern to make sure only image links 
matching that are collected.
2. linkGrabMode was set to extreme here instead of normal because most
of the images weren't embedded on the page the normal way. For example,
if you right-click on some of the images, you won't be able to save them.
All acceptable values are: normal, extensive, extreme.
