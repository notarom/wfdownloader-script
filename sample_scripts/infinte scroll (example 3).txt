THIS IS A COMMENT TO EXPLAIN WHAT THIS CODE DOES, IT CAN BE REMOVED.
The code below (from line 11) will extract the links to the collections
on the scrollable Unsplash page https://unsplash.com/@fiona_133/collections
1. '/collections/' was used as the filter pattern to make sure only links 
matching that are collected.
2. linkGrabMode was set to normal here. Acceptable values are:
normal, extensive, extreme.
